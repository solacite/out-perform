be the better employee and make the best performance! a rhythm game where your rank increases the better your high score is.

## summary ig

it's a rhythm game where your goal is to be "attractive" - not to have game with the manager (lmao???), but to make your resume as shiny as possible by increasing the rank of each colour track you're given.

i used Godot for making the actual game ('cause it's a game engine!), Procreate for the art/assets, and Ableton to make the music/audio :D

i made it 'cause i've never madea  rhythm game before, so i did it! although i struggled with bugs related to Godot's audio bus, especially when trying to build it for itch.
